### Think Like A Manager
#### Think like a manager when choosing your answers.
**Due Diligence (Think before you act. - (Do Detect))**
Practicing the activites that maintain the due care effort. Increases understanding and reduces risk. This is typically done before a decision except for the "evaluation". That should be a reoccuring practice using internal and external audits.  
Covers: Research, Planning, and Evaluation  
- Examples:  
	- Laws and regulations
	- Standards
	- Best practices
**Due Care (Actions speak louder than words - (Do Correct))**
Doing what a reasonable person would do in a given situation (prudent man rule).  
Covers: Implementation, Operation, and Reasonable measures  
- Examples:  
	- Reporting security incidents
	- Security awareness training
	- Disabling access In a timely way

Due Diligence and Due Care together reduce cupability and (downstream) liability when a loss occurs.  

Thinking like a manager is about **knowing priorities**.
|Responsability|Level|Priorities & Objectives|
|---|---|---|
| Strategic - long term|CISO| Human safety, business continuity, protect profits, reduce liability & risk |
| Tactical - midrange|IT Director/Manager | Policy and planning |
| Operational - short term| IT Engineer | Implement and operate |

**Don't Touch, Advise** - During the exam, think like an outside consultant advising on strategy, priorities, and sfety, not doing.
