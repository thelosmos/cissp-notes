### Countermeasure selection and implementation
### Applicable types of controls (e.g., preventive, detective, corrective)
### Control assessments (security and privacy)
### Monitoring and measurement
### Reporting

### Risk frameworks

*Increases risk or susceptibility*  

**Physical damage** - Natural disaster, power loss or vandalism  
**Malfunctions** - Failure of systems, networks, or peripherals  
**Attacks** - Purposeful acts wheter from the inside or outside, such as unauthorized disclosure
